              <p>
                Welcome to the River C's poker page! We are a group of friends
                that really like to take each others hard earned money. Winning
                money is fun and all but really we just needed an excuse to get
                away from reality and spend some time together. Our group
                started playing together in 2018, and half way through 2020 we
                decided to create a league. The league was created to try to
                keep consistency within the group, and to play for a bigger pot
                at the end of the year. At the end of 2020 our total pot was
                $360. Visit the

                to see the 2020 champion and the rest of the league!

                <h2>How the league works</h2>
              </div>
              <p>
                Everyone is welcome to join in on the games that we play.
                However, to be apart of the league requires a little bit more
                commitment. The league gets together once a month and in order
                to compete at the end of the year players can't miss more than
                one game throughout the year, and each player will also need to
                host a game within the year. The league fee is $5 every game, or
                $60 up front or at the end of the year. The final league pot
                will vary on the number of players in the league that year, but
                will usually sit around $400 - $500.

                Our whole group lives in the Ogden, Utah valley. Some of us have
                known eachother since highschool and some work with one another.
                Either way its a small city that brought us all together.
                Depending on the night, that can be a good thing or bad thing.
                Regardless of where you are from, if you are interested in
                playing some friendly poker consistently join our poker group on
